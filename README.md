CodSoft

This repository contains the completed projects from my virtual internship, which ran from 15th September 2024 to 15th October 2024. The projects showcase my skills in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through three distinct tasks:

Landing Page Design: A modern, responsive landing page built with basic HTML and CSS. The design focuses on clean layout and user-friendly navigation, showcasing my ability to create visually appealing front-end components.

Portfolio Website: A personalized portfolio website featuring sections like "About Me," "Skills," "Projects," and a downloadable resume link. The website highlights my technical skills, projects, and experience in a well-structured and professional manner.

Calculator Application: A functional calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, capable of performing basic arithmetic operations. This project enhanced my understanding of JavaScript logic and interactive user interface design.
